/*
Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. 
You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. 
You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.

Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().

Use .bind() when you want that function to later be called with a certain context, useful in events. Use .call() or .apply() 
when you want to invoke the function immediately, and modify the context.


Call/apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function
